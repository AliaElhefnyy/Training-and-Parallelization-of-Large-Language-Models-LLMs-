# LLM Labs ‚Äì PyTorch for Large Language Models

This repository contains Python labs for the **"Training and Parallelization of Large Language Models (LLMs)"** course, offered at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport (AASTMT) in collaboration with Virginia Tech (Summer 2025).

## üîç About the Course
This course explores how to train, optimize, and parallelize large language models (LLMs) using techniques like:
- Data, model, pipeline, and tensor parallelism
- Distributed training
- Fine-tuning and benchmarking TinyLlama

## üìÅ Lab 1: Introduction to PyTorch
Topics covered:
- What is PyTorch?
- Tensor operations and autograd
- Training a simple linear regression model
- Classwork for hands-on practice

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To run the notebooks, install:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib
